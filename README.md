<h3 align="">Hi, I’m Karl!</h3>
<p>
A passionate cybersecurity expert and relentless tinkerer. I specialize in hacking, offensive security research, and incident response. When I’m not chasing vulnerabilities, I’m building tools, experimenting with technology, and diving deep into the world of secure coding and systems design.

This GitHub Account is my creative playground — a space where I share tools, scripts, and projects that make cybersecurity a little bit more accessible and exciting for everyone.
