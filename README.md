Hi, I’m Karl! I’m passionate about hacking and cybersecurity. Currently, I work as a Principal Incident Responder, but I also dive into offensive security research and experiments.

This repository is a hub for various projects I’m working on. While many of my finance-related tools are private, I’ve made most of my hacking tools, where permissible, publicly available.

Thanks for checking out my work!
