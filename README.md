 <h1 align="center">👨‍💻 It me!</h1>

My name is Karl. I love hacking and cyber security, currently working as a senior soc analyst, but also doing offensive shenanigans and research.
I use this repo for all sorts of projects, a lot of the finance ones are private, but most of the hacking tools, that I am allowed to share, are public. 

Thanks for stopping by!
Catch you on the bit side! (literally - Blue Team humor 😄)
