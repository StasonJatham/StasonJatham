# Hello

I’m Karl.

I currently serve as **Head of Incident Response** at **Germany’s second-largest public authority**, where I lead and coordinate the response to high-impact security incidents in complex, highly regulated environments. My work spans strategic incident leadership, hands-on technical analysis, and the design of resilient security and response processes at scale.

My background combines deep practical experience in incident response with offensive security research and secure systems engineering. I focus on understanding real-world attacker behavior, improving detection and response capabilities, and building reliable tooling for security operations.

This GitHub account is a professional workspace where I publish selected tools, scripts, and research projects related to cybersecurity, automation, and secure infrastructure. Some projects remain private due to operational, legal, or compliance requirements.
